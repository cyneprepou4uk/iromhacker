		<h2>Config and input files</h2>
        <p class="tip">
            If you want to see a successful example of a disassembly which I made for Captain Tsubasa 2 ROM, download <a href="BZK 6502.zip">this archive</a> and try for yourself. Make sure to unpack it into "C:\BZK 6502" folder if it's the first time you're using it. Note that this example might use an outdated disssembler version.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you've downloaded the <a href="https://github.com/cyneprepou4uk/BZK-6502-Disassembler/releases" target="_blank">latest release</a>, open <text class="label">config.lua</text> file with a text editor. You're gonna need to edit this config depending on your needs and on your game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that HEX values must be written with <text class="label">"0x"</text> at the beginning. For example, to specify <text class="address">$8000</text>, you actually write <text class="label">0x8000</text>.
        </p>
        <h3>Input</h3>
        <p>
            Place <text class="label">ROM_file</text>, <text class="label">CDL_file</text> and table files (from <text class="label">ASM_config_table</text> option) into <text class="label">"input"</text> folder, then specify their names and paths in a config file.
        </p>
        <h4>INPUT_folder and OUTPUT_folder</h4>
        <p>
            <text class="label">INPUT_folder</text> is where your <text class="label">.nes</text>, <text class="label">.cdl</text> and <text class="label">.tbl</text> files must be placed before launching the disassembler.
        </p>
        <p>
            <text class="label">OUTPUT_folder</text> is where your output files will appear once my disassembler does his stuff. Note that the disassembler doesn't clear this folder before creating new files, and existing files with the same name will be overwritten.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, Lua doesn't work with relative paths out of the box, so I need to specify paths manually. Default folder (where <text class="label">LAUNCHME.bat</text> file is located) is <text class="label">C:\BZK 6502</text>, this is where you need to unpack the disassembler if you're not planning to edit these paths.
        </p>
        <p>
            In case you've decided to change paths for <text class="label">INPUT_folder</text> and <text class="label">OUTPUT_folder</text> folders, note that all <text class="label">"\"</text> symbols must be replaced with <text class="label">"/"</text> symbols, and the final symbol of the path should also be <text class="label">"/"</text>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another important thing: both folders must actually exist, and paths should not contain any weird symbols, only Latin letters, numbers, spaces, underlines and some others are allowed. Otherwise the disassembler will throw an error.
        </p>
        <h4>ROM_file</h4>
        <p>
            This is a name of your game file. Default name is <text class="label">"game.nes"</text>, and it must be placed in <text class="label">\input\game.nes</text> by default.
        </p>
        <p>
            Disassembler will be taking header, PRG (code and data) and CHR (graphics) bytes from this file.
        </p>
        <h4>CDL_file</h4>
        <p>
            This is a name of your CDL file which was produced by your emulator. Default name is <text class="label">"game.cdl"</text>, and it must be placed in <text class="label">\input\game.cdl</text> by default.
        </p>
        <p>
            Disassembler will be taking flags from this file and paste code/data respectively in assembly files.
        </p>
        <h3>Output</h3>
        <h4>HEADER_file</h4>
        <p>
            This option has 3 arguments. By default you don't need to change those.
        </p>
        <li>Name of the header file. Default name is <text class="label">"header.bin"</text>, and it will appear in <text class="label">\output\header.bin</text>.</li>
        <li>Start address from the <text class="label">ROM_file</text>. Header is located at the very beginning of the file, so the address is <text class="label">0x000000</text> by default.</li>
        <li>Size of a header. NES header is a 16 bytes string, so size should be <text class="label">0x10</text>. But if your <text class="label">ROM_file</text> doesn't have a header, or if you simply don't want a header file as an output, set size to <text class="label">0x0</text>.</li>
        <h4>CHR_file</h4>
        <p>
            This option has 3 arguments.
        </p>
        <li>Name of the CHR file. Default name is <text class="label">"CHR_ROM.chr"</text>, and it will appear in <text class="label">\output\CHR_ROM.chr</text>.</li>
        <li>Start address from the <text class="label">ROM_file</text>. CHR is located after PRG. The disassembler doesn't calculate address and size of the CHR, you need to do this manually.
        <li>Size of a CHR file. If your <text class="label">ROM_file</text> doesn't have a CHR, or if you simply don't want a CHR file as an output, set size to <text class="label">0x0</text>.</li>
        <h4>RAM_file</h4>
        <p>
            This is a name of the file which will contain labels for RAM addresses (<text class="address">$0000-$07FF</text>).
        </p>
        <p>
            If the disassembler will detect any usage of <text class="label">SRAM</text> addresses (<text class="address">$6000-$7FFF</text>), it will add labels to those as well. However, output ASM files won't have these labels. <text class="label">RAM_file</text> will print a manual about how to deal with this.
        </p>
        <h4>RAM_usage_output</h4>
        <p>
            Additional information for <text class="label">RAM_file</text>. This option can show you how many times the disassembler has detected usage of a particular address, and addressing modes of the instructions that were using this address. It might give you some useful information if you figure out how to use it. Set to <text class="label">false</text> if you don't want to print them in a <text class="label">RAM_file</text>.
        </p>
        <p class="tip">
            For example if RAM_file says that this address was used only once, it is a circumstantial evidence of this address actually being useless in the game. Note that the disassembler only counts addresses from instructions operands if these instructions were logged as code. Which means that there can be more unlogged addresses usages out there.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most useful options are <text class="label">9</text> ($indirect), <text class="label">10</text> ($indirect,X) and <text class="label">11</text> ($indirect),Y. ($indirect) is a <text class="opcode">JMP</text> ($xxxx) instruction. ($indirect,X) is something like <text class="opcode">LDA</text> ($xx,X) instruction. ($indirect),Y is something like <text class="opcode">LDA</text> ($xx),Y instruction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Indirect addressing mode uses 2 neighboring addresses, for example <text class="opcode">LDA</text> ($00),Y uses both <text class="address">$00</text> and <text class="address">$01</text>. But the disassembler doesn't count the usage of the second <text class="address">$01</text> address in this case, it only takes the address <text class="address">$00</text> into account.
        </p>
        <h4>DEBUG_file</h4>
        <p>
            This is a name of the file which contains the same information as <text class="label">RAM_file</text> does (besides labels), but it will contain that info for the whole <text class="address">$0000-$FFFF</text> CPU range, and will print all available counters despite <text class="label">RAM_usage_output</text> options. This file can also be somewhat useful in some cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Default name is <text class="label">"debug.txt"</text>, and it will appear in <text class="label">\output\debug.txt</text>. If you don't want this file as an output, set the 2nd argument to <text class="label">false</text>.
        </p>
        <h4>FORCE_byte_comments</h4>
        <p>
            If no text was specified to this byte inside a table file, or if a table file was not configured for this bank, it can still print <text class="label">";"</text> near this byte. Can be convenient later for manually adding comments to bytes from some tables. If set to <text class="label">true</text>:
        </p>
        <img src="1.png">
        <p>
            If set to <text class="label">false</text>:
        </p>
        <img src="2.png">
        <h4>ASM_config_table</h4>
        <p>
            This table contains 5 arguments for each ASM file. The disassembler doesn't calculate banks depending on the mapper, you need to specify arguments yourself. You can have as many banks as you want, and you don't need to disassembly the whole PRG ROM if you don't want to.
        </p>
        <li>Name of the assembly file. If the name is <text class="label">"bank_00.asm"</text>, file will appear in <text class="label">\output\bank_00.asm</text>. If you specify the same name to some other ASM files, disassembly will be appended to this file, not overwritten. However I don't recommend you doing that for banks with the same NES Memory addresses, because of my autolabeling Notepad++ scripts.</li>
        <li>Start ROM File address from your <text class="label">ROM_file</text>. If your ROM has a header, then the very first bank is located starting from <text class="label">0x000010</text>.</li>
        <li>Base NES Memory address for current bank. Usually you need to map code/data for a bank starting from <text class="label">0x8000</text>, <text class="label">0xA000</text>, <text class="label">0xC000</text> or <text class="label">0xE000</text>. In case you're not sure what base address you need, set it to <text class="label">0x8000</text> for now, and then read about <text class="label">Data Mapping flag</text> from the next article.</li></li>
        <li>Size of the bank. Usually size should be <text class="label">0x2000</text>, <text class="label">0x4000</text> or <text class="label">0x8000</text>. If base address is <text class="label">0x8000</text>, and size is <text class="label">0x2000</text>, code/data will be mapped at <text class="address">$8000-$9FFF</text> (the last address of this range must not exceed <text class="address">$FFFF</text>).</li>
        <li>Name of the table file, it will be used for bytes which were not logged as code. If you don't want to use a table file for the current bank, set to <text class="label">false</text>.</li>
        <p>
            A table file looks like a regular table file which you were probably using before at some point. For my disassembler it should contain <text class="underline">all 256 bytes</text>, starting from <text class="label">"00="</text> and ending with <text class="label">"FF="</text>. The disassembler doesn't actually look at bytes, it just counts lines of the file and reads text starting from <text class="label">4th</text> symbol, which is right after <text class="label">"="</text>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can specify any <text class="label">UTF-8</text> text after <text class="label">"="</text> to those bytes (like Japanese or whatever), and several symbols if you want, not just single symbols as you're used to (like letters and numbers). In case there is no text after <text class="label">"="</text>, this byte will be ignored and nothing will be printed next to this byte in ASM file.
